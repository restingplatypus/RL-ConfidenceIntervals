# RL-ConfidenceIntervals
Consider a problem of computing optimal policies (i.e. a policy with maximum expected reward.) in a finite state irreducible Markov reward chain. We compute confidencee intervals with coverage probability equal to one for the expected long run average reward. Specifically, we obtain upper and lower bounds specifying the confidence intervals using a simulation method. The method is based on the following paper:
Burnetas and Katehakis - "On confidence intervals from simulation of finite Markov chains.", _Mathematical methods of operations research, 1997_.__
